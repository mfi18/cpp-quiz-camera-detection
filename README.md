# C++ Quiz Game with Gesture Control

This project is a quiz based game developed in C++ using SFML for graphics and OpenCV for real time hand gesture recognition. The game supports both mouse based interaction and webcam based gesture input.

## Overview

The game presents multiple choice questions to the player. Selections can be made either through mouse clicks or by detecting finger gestures via a webcam. The system includes scoring logic, visual feedback, sound effects, and difficulty handling.

## Features

- Multiple choice quiz system

- Mouse based input

- Hand gesture based input using OpenCV

- Real time finger counting for option selection

- Score and combo based mechanics

- Visual effects and sound feedback

- Persistent high score storage

## Controls
### Mouse

- Click on options to select answers

### Hand Gestures

- One to four fingers select corresponding options

- Five fingers pause or resume the game

## Technologies Used

- C++

- SFML

- OpenCV

## Requirements

- C++ compiler

- SFML installed and linked

- OpenCV installed and linked

- Webcam for gesture based input

## How to Run

- Install SFML

- Install OpenCV

- Ensure the assets folder is present in the project root

- Compile the source code with SFML and OpenCV linked

- Run the executable


### Notes

- Tested on Windows

- Gesture mode requires proper lighting for accurate detection

- OpenCV must have camera access

### Status

- The project is functional and complete. Further improvements and optimizations may be added in the future.
